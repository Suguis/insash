# Insash

> Note: the game is discontinued, but you can download it [here](https://bitivyte.itch.io/insash). It has 20 levels.

Here is Insash! A simple but challenging puzzle game for Android, to play when you are taking a break, or whenever you want! Included two languages: English and Spanish.

You need to pass through color blocks to destroy them, and go to the round cell to pass the level.

Color blocks have their own resistance:

- Light blue: one step.
- Green: two steps.
- Orange: three steps.
- Red: four steps.
- Other: indestructible.
- You also should complete the level in the least number of movements. If you complete one with that condition you will win a purple range on it, otherwise you can get a gold range or white range (the worst).

Credits are in the game.
